# Tutorial-club-convergence-regional-price-Indonesia_Harry-Ch2
This tutorial contains R code, data and output for my chapter entitled "Spatial dynamics of consumer price in Indonesia - convergence clubs and conditioning factors".

The project includes the codes to generate:
- graphs in the "Stylized fact" section,
- results of log-t-reg and club convergence identification,
- the transition path graph, and
- results of ordered logit model to investigate the conditioning factors of
club convergence.
